# TO DO
- local storage
- multiplayer

## ideas
- row boat minions as crew
- upgrade boat to be faster

## 2nd iteration in 3d
- I want the game to play like a gameboy emulator so you can play on your phone and on computer
- walking around on islands will be like playing pokemon with sea of thieves fighting and interaction
- driving the ship will be different.
    - it should be a nice sailing experience
    - i dont want it to just be a top down view, I want you also to be able to look out on the horizon
- controlling the ship will be with a wheel, sails, compass, map, and coordinates? maybe sextant and time-piece
